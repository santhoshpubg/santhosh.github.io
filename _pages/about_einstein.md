Hello everyone,

I'm Santhosh, an enthusiastic IT professional with over 16 years of experience in the industry, currently based in Dublin, Ireland. I'm thrilled to be embarking on a new adventure with VMware (Broadcom), where I'll be bringing my expertise in IT infrastructure, particularly in Engineering & Operations, to the table.

My journey in the tech world has been dynamic and fulfilling. Previously, I had the privilege of serving as an Infrastructure Architect at SAP, where I played a crucial role in designing and implementing multiple Software-Defined Data Centers (SDDCs) for SAP's E-Commerce (Hybris) product. During my tenure, I led global Cloud Operations teams, contributing to the success of the company. Before SAP, I honed my skills at esteemed organizations like Infosys Ltd., Nuance Communications Inc., and HCL, spanning across India, Canada, and the UK. My focus has always been on infrastructure management services and cloud operations.

Beyond the confines of the office, I find immense joy in spending quality time with my family - my wife, Aruna, and our son, Deendayal. Weekends are synonymous with my passion for cricket, where I actively participate as a member of the Leinster cricket club and enjoy coaching young talents. Additionally, I'm an avid motorcycle enthusiast and proudly ride with a group of fellow bikers in Dublin whenever the weather permits.

I'm excited to connect with all of you, share experiences, and learn from each other in both personal and professional capacities.
